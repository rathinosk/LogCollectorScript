# filepaths.txt - List of File Paths
# 
# This file contains source and destination file paths for log collection.
# Each line should specify a source path and a destination path, separated by a space.
# Lines starting with '#' are considered comments and will be ignored.
# Blank lines will also be skipped.
# 
# Example:
# 
# source\path\to\logs relative\destination\path
# source\path\to\more\logs another\relative\destination\path
# 
# Note: Ensure there are no leading or trailing spaces on each line.
# All destination paths will be relative to the destination path specified in the collect.bat.
